    "Matrices have a good number of use-cases, but one stand out use case is using matrices to represent linear transformations. A linear transformation is function that takes in an input and produces an output however is is called a linear trasnformation and not a linear function because this transformation denotes movement. A linear transformation is a trransformation in which grid lines are evenly spaced and remain parallel to each other and the origin doesn't change. Thus there is no curvature in linear transformations."
